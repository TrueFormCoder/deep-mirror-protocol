# Deep Mirror Protocol

Deep Mirror Protocol is a framework for identifying and articulating patterns of silence, avoidance, and delayed truth in human systems.

This repository contains the canonical essays and protocol artifacts for the project.

## Scope

The work here focuses on:
- Narrative pattern analysis
- Cross-case synthesis
- Structural interpretation of observable behavior
- Systems-level dynamics rather than individual diagnosis

## What This Is Not

- Not therapy
- Not diagnosis
- Not coaching
- Not self-help content

Nothing in this repository is prescriptive. The goal is clarity, not correction.

## Contents

- Canonical essays (static HTML)
- Method and scope notes
- Protocol definitions
- Pattern series (e.g. *The Cold Exit*)

## Publishing Model

The canonical source of truth lives at:
