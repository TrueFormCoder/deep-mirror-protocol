<h1>Pattern 002: Silent Accumulation</h1>

<p>
Endurance is often mistaken for generosity.
</p>

<p>
In conflict-avoidant systems, people take pride in what they do not say, what they absorb quietly, and what they manage without complaint. Over time, endurance becomes identity: the reasonable one, the stable one, the low-maintenance one.
</p>

<p>
The cost of this identity is that unmet needs are never negotiated. They are stored.
</p>

<p>
What accumulates is not anger. Anger would require engagement. What accumulates is resentment without accountability.
</p>

<p>
Because dissatisfaction is never expressed as need, it is reinterpreted internally as judgment. The other party becomes demanding, ungrateful, or insufficient — often without having changed their behavior at all.
</p>

<p>
From the outside, nothing appears wrong. From the inside, a moral ledger is forming.
</p>

<p>
When departure finally occurs, it feels justified to the leaver and inexplicable to everyone else.
</p>

<p>
Endurance without disclosure is not generosity.  
It is deferred rupture.
