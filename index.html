<h1>Deep Mirror Protocol</h1>

<p>
Deep Mirror Protocol examines patterns of silence, conflict avoidance, and delayed truth in human systems.
</p>

<p>
The work published here is descriptive, not prescriptive. It does not offer treatment, diagnosis, or advice.
Its purpose is to name structures that are often experienced privately but rarely articulated clearly.
</p>

<p>
The protocol focuses on observable behavior, narrative patterns, and structural dynamics rather than individual pathology.
