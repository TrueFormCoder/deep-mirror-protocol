<h1>Pattern 003: Presence Without Protection</h1>

<p>
Children are often told that a parent’s continued contact means they were not abandoned.
</p>

<p>
This is an adult definition.
</p>

<p>
From a child’s perspective, abandonment is not defined by absence alone. It is defined by the loss of predictability, emotional availability, and the sense of being chosen.
</p>

<p>
When a parent exits abruptly but maintains intermittent contact, the child experiences a contradiction: affection without reliability, presence without containment.
</p>

<p>
The parent is still there, but no longer oriented around the child’s life.
</p>

<p>
This ambiguity prevents grief from completing and prevents trust from reforming. The child learns that connection does not guarantee commitment, and that love may withdraw without explanation.
</p>

<p>
What harms children in these cases is not cruelty. It is opacity.
</p>

<p>
Presence without protection is not safety.  
It is exposure.
